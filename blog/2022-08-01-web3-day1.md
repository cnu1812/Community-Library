## ===== DAY 1 =====

Alright let’s go, the first of 30 exciting days, I want to start things off by sharing something personal - my own reason for why I’m so excited about web3 development. A very common phrase that gets thrown around in crypto/web3 is ***“You’re still early”***. But come on, are we really early? Have you stopped and wondered how many web3 developers are there actually out there?

Well, I have the answer for you - turns out we (aspiring web3 developers) are indeed still very early! Electric Capital (a crypto VC) generated a Developer Report for the year of 2021 and the insights are really interesting. I’ll leave you to look through and unpack the 130 page report by yourself. Don’t worry, its mostly graphs! The article below provides a good summary of the report as well.

Today’s discussion question: **What in the developer report stood out the most to you? Why?**
