## <u>Quest Screenshot Submissions:</u> What if I don't have a taskbar? 

Not everyone uses the **Windows or Mac** operating systems. There are many other operating systems like **Ubuntu and their distributions**. However, when submitting screenshots for StackUp quests, a ***taskbar is required***. Stackies without taskbars in their screenshots can be <u>rejected</u> when their quests are reviewed, since that is a requirement. 

### The solution?

 For Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux distribution users, install a **GNOME Shell extension** which will allow you to display a taskbar. You can find it [here](https://technastic.com/windows-like-taskbar-ubuntu-gnome/):
