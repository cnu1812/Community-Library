# Day 9

Hello, for this week's challenge, you have the option to build: 

1⃣ A Product Landing Page (you can decide what product you want to feature - it can be something you like)

2⃣ A Personal Portfolio Site (so that you can feature your JS Quiz in it)
Let's try to complete this by Sunday! So you have about 5 days!
 
If you are not familiar with creating a landing page, here's two tutorials that you can follow along:

➡️ Create one using Canva (no coding but assumes you know Canva): https://bit.ly/landingpage-canva.

➡️ With HTML and CSS: https://bit.ly/landingpage-css 
 
For building a portfolio website, here's one by freeCodeCamp. Watch until 2:08:44. It's a pretty long video, so maybe split up the coding into 4 days. https://bit.ly/portfoliosite-fcc

As usual feel free to share your buildings...
