# Day 8

Hello, last week you got quite a bit of knowledge on **Javascript**. You guys have worked hard and created amazing builds of the Quiz. 🎆  If you're still building, no worries, the thread to share your builds will be kept active. But what I would suggest is to maybe push out a basic version first. And then subsequently you can continue to work on it. 

This week, we are now moving on to learn about ***Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)*** and the design of web pages 🎨 . We've got quite a number of folks here who said that they felt they could improve their design sense, and I've specially curated these resources for you guys. So please enjoy! 🧑‍🎨 

Today's article covers:
 1. the history of CSS.
 2. discusses the history of layouts in CSS, from table layout -> float-based layout -> flexbox layout / grid layout.
 3. also covers the use of CSS preprocessors and postprocessors. 
 4. I thought the part on CSS postprocessors was pretty useful, because while inspecting some sites' stylesheet, you might have noticed the -webkit prefix and wondered about what it is.
