# Day 6

Hello, hope you guys are doing fine in this pathway of 30 Days of Web 2. Today's the third day since we started building our multiple choice quiz game. If you've completed it, do remember to share with us. Otherwise, the weekend is a pretty good time to build if you have the time. 

Two days ago, you read about the long history of Javascript. In fact, did you know Javascript was created in 1995, and is now 27 years old! A number of scripting languages have popped up along the way, but Javascript continues to remain popular. Why is that? Read today's article to understand why Javascript will likely remain a popular language.

Once you're done reading, here are some questions that you can think about:

- Do you think Javascript is the scripting language of the future? Or are there other languages that are strong competitors? 
- For those who picked up Javascript, why did you do so? 
- How's your experience with Javascript so far?

Feel free to answer above questions...
