Hello folks! Today we are building! This is a start of a series of projects that we will be building in this challenge. Once you have completed your build, you can push it to GitHub and share your repo with us. 

For our first build, we will start with building a **Javascript Quiz Game**. Since everyone here has different levels of familiarity with web development, it would be interesting to see what you build. Please build a quiz game with at least two questions. At the minimum, the question type will be MCQ. 

For beginners, you might want to complete the Javascript campaign on the StackUp platform first, then refer to this tutorial where you will be building a MCQ quiz that gives the score upon pressing a button: https://bit.ly/js-quiz-build  .

For more experienced web developers, the challenge is for you to create a more advanced quiz game. Some suggestions would be to accept fill in the blank answers that utilises regex, or create a MCQ quiz with a timer.
