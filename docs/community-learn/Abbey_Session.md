### Things to try

After watching the video, Abbey prepared an activity that will let you practice everything you need to contribute to open source.

The said activity is called the [Stackie 2023 resolution](https://stackie-2023-resolution.vercel.app). Its goal is to let Stackies share each otherâ€™s resolutions for this year. Every Stackie will be able to pull a request, raise an issue, and code review.

You can also head to the Resources section of the website to view the repositories you can also contribute to as a beginner. 
You can make your own project and share to the community!
