### (Step 3) Issue: "npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine" while running "npm install"
It's probably a node version issue. You'll need the 16.16.0. To check your node version run at the terminal:
```node --version```
if it's not the needed version, you have 2 ways to downgrade it:

**If you have nvm installed:**
1. Open your terminal and run:
```
nvm list
```
2. a) If it shows the 16.16.0 version run:
```
nvm use 16.16.0
```
2. b) If it not shows, run:
```
nvm install 16.16.0
```
and then:
```
nvm use 16.16.0
```
3. Run ```node --version``` in your terminal again and if it's showing "v16.16.0", you can continue with the quests.

**Install via executable**
1. Go to the [node page](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install the **16.16.0 LTS** version.
2. Run ```node --version``` in your terminal again and if it's showing "v16.16.0", you can continue with the quests.

Ps: If you still recieve some errors after installing 16.16.0, try:
- Run ```npm start``` ignoring the errrors.
- If it doesn't work, try install the 12.16.0 version and run ```npm install``` again.
