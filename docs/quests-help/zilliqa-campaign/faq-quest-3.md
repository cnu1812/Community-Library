This is the FAQ of the ***Quest 3: Hello World! Deploying and Inspecting Your First Smart Contract with Scilla***. If you can't solve your issue here, you still can ask your doubt in the discord server (#zilliqa-helpdesk channel).

### (Step 6) Issue: Zil Faucet transaction taking much time
The transaction takes around 5-10 mins. If it's not working for you:
- Refresh the page.
- Check whether you change to the *testnet* network.
  1. Open your ZilPay (extension)
  2. Click in the gear icon.
  3. Go to Account and change the *Selected Network* to testnet.
  4. And finally, click at the close icon (x) (**not the reset button**) and check whether your transaction is done.
