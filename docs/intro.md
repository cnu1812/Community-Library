Let's discover **how to setup this project locally in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **forking** the project from **[Github](https://github.com/cnu1812/community-library)**.

### Then open a terminal in your system

   - `` mkdir community-library ``
   - `` cd community-library ``
   - `` git clone https://github.com/<your github user name>/Community-Library.git ``
   - `` yarn `` or `` yarn install ``
   - `` yarn start ``

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### leave the first terminal open.

#### In second terminal

   - `` cd community-library ``
   - `` code . ``
